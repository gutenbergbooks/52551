<li><i>Fig. 1.</i> A reel with two iron bars, made use of to double
the wire, and cut the doubled wire twice the length
required for fixing the corks in the bottles.</li>

<li><i>Fig. 2.</i> A small machine for twisting the wire one-third
of its length after having been doubled by
fig. 1.</li>

<li><i>Fig. 3.</i> An instrument for compressing (and, as it were,
biting) the corks three quarters of their length, beginning
at the smallest end.</li>

<li><i>Fig. 4.</i> A stool stuffed with straw, furnished with a
wooden stand on which the bottles may be placed
to be tied. The same stool will serve to sit on
during the corking.</li>

<li><i>Fig. 5.</i> A hollow block of wood, called a bottle-boot
(Casse-Bouteille), within which the bottle is set
when it is to be corked. This bottle-boot is furnished
with a strong bat for beating in the corks.</li>

<li><i>Fig. 6.</i> A front and side view of pointed pincers, used
for twisting the wire employed to keep on the
corks, and for cutting off the superfluous ends of
the wire. I make use of flat pincers and scissars
for this operation.</li>

<h2><a name="ADVERTISEMENT" id="ADVERTISEMENT"></a>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>In an advertisement prefixed to
the pamphlet, of which the following
sheets are a translation,
the author publishes his address:
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quai Napoléon, au coin de la
rue de la Colombe, No. 4, dans
la Cité, à Paris</i>;” and offers
for sale there, an assortment of
provisions, preserved by the process,
of which an account is here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
communicated to the public. As
the book itself is a recommendation
of the author’s own goods, it
has been thought proper to add
to his account of his process,
a translation of the authorities
and testimonies by which his own
statements are authenticated; notwithstanding
the repetitions which
are in consequence admitted. The
recommendation of the process by
the French Minister immediately
follows. The more elaborate Report
of the Paris Society for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
Encouragement of National Industry,
will be found at the end of
the work.</p>

<p>It is needless to anticipate the
author’s display of the advantages
which must flow from a simple and
unexpensive process of keeping
fresh articles of animal and vegetable
food. If this can be effected
for only <em>one year</em>, that is, from
the season of produce through the
seasons of scarcity; if no other
articles, for instance, than eggs,
cream, and vegetables, can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
preserved in their full flavour and
excellence during a long winter,
there is not a mistress of a family
in the kingdom, rich enough to
lay by a stock of those articles,
and not too rich to despise the
economy of a family, who will
not find herself benefitted by the
perusal of the small work here put
within her reach; and there is no
reason to suspect the correctness
of this part of the author’s statements.
This, however, is but one
of the more obvious benefits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
his process; and if thus much be
ascertained, then an interminable
prospect of resources is opened,
which the State, still more than
the individual, will be called upon
to employ.</p>

<p>The author, in his enumeration
of the advantages to be derived
from his process, places at the
head, the saving it will occasion in
the consumption of sugar. This
process, added to recent improvement
in the art of preparing grape
syrup, holds forth, in his opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
a prospect of relief to the suffering
proprietors of French vineyards.
This statement will have been listened
to with great complacency
by the French government, which
so ostentatiously avows the determination
to compel the whole
Continent to subsist on its own
produce, and dispense with the
more luxurious of transatlantic
commodities. Our country, however,
from its soil and climate,
can take little or no share in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
branch of the application of the
author’s process.</p>

<p>On the other hand it offers us
incalculable benefits in the equipment
and victualling of our fleets,
and in providing for the health and
comfort of the floating defence of
the country, as well as of that
numerous and meritorious class of
men, to which the nation owes so
much of its prosperity. Whatever
promises an improvement in the
condition of every order of men
who subsist on the Ocean, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
be considered as an object of
national concern. The French
government, at least on the part
of some of its members in the
subordinate branches of its administration,
has taken the lead in
recommending the author’s process
to the attention of public functionaries.
From the superior activity,
as well as more enlightened discernment
of the people of this
country, we may expect that our
author’s process will excite equally
the notice of the government and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
country at large; and we trust
that government-contractors and
commissioners, as well as the pursers
of men of war, and the stewards
of merchantmen, will not be the last
to examine for themselves the promising
statements of our author.</p>

<p>From the public papers we learn
that a patent has been taken out
for preserving provisions according
to the process described in this
book. We do not pretend to determine
how far this patent may interfere
with the adoption by other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
persons of this same process as a
manufactory and trade; but, it is
certain, that on the small scale on
which provisions would be preserved
for single families, every person
will be at liberty to avail himself
of the instructions he may meet
with in this volume.</p>

<p>It was thought less objectionable
to insert unnecessary matter,
than to omit what to some readers
might be useful or interesting.
Every thing, therefore, has been
translated, and we have even copied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
the author’s plate of the machinery
used in corking bottles,
though from our improved state of
mechanics, the greater part of our
readers will stand in no need of its
assistance, similar machines being
in common use by the wine-coopers,

has reported to me, Sir, the examination
it has made of your process for the
preservation of fruits, vegetables, meat,
soup, milk, &amp;c. and from that report
no doubt can be entertained of the success
of such process. As the preservation
of animal and vegetable substances
may be of the utmost utility in Sea-voyages,
in hospitals and domestic
economy, I deem your discovery worthy
an especial mark of the good will of
the government. I have in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
acceded to the recommendation made
me by my council to grant you a recompence
of 12,000 francs.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> In so
doing I had in view the assigning you
the reward due to the inventors of useful
processes, and also the indemnifying
you for the expences you have been
obliged to incur, either in the forming
your establishment or in the experiments
necessary to establish the success
of your process. You shall be immediately
informed when you may repair
to the public treasury and receive the
12,000 francs.</p>

<p>It appears to me of importance, Sir,
that you should spread the knowledge
of your preserving process. I desire,
therefore, that agreeably to your own
proposal, you will digest a detailed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
exact description of your process. This
description, which you will remit to my
Board of Arts and Manufactures, shall
be printed at your expence, after it shall
have been examined. You will then
transmit me 200 copies. The transmission
of these copies being the only condition
I impose on you for the payment
of the 12,000 francs, I doubt not you
will hasten to fulfil it. I desire, Sir,
you will acknowledge the receipt of
my letter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHI" id="CHI"></a>§ I.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap bigger">All</span> the expedients hitherto made
use of for preserving alimentary and
medicinal substances, may be reduced
to two principal methods; that of dessication;
and that of mingling, in
greater or less quantities, a foreign
substance for the purpose of impeding
fermentation or putrefaction.</p>

<p>It is by the former of these methods
that we are furnished with smoaked
and hung meat, dried fish, fruits,
and vegetables. By the latter, we obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
fruits and other vegetable substances
preserved in sugar, the juices
and decoctions of plants reduced to
syrups and essences, all kinds of
pickles, salted meat and vegetables.
But each of these modes has its peculiar
inconveniences. Dessication takes away
the odour, changes the taste of the
juices, and hardens the fibrous or
pulpy matter (the <em>porenchyma</em>).</p>

<p>Sugar, from the strength of its own
flavour, conceals and destroys in part
other flavours, even that, the enjoyment
of which we wish to preserve, such as
the pleasant acidity of many fruits. A
second inconvenience is this, that a
large quantity of sugar is required in
order to preserve a small quantity of
some other vegetable matter; and
hence the use of it is not only very
costly, but even in many cases pernicious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Thus the juices of certain
plants cannot be reduced to a syrup or
essence, but by means of nearly double
the quantity of sugar. It results from
this, that those syrups or essences contain
much more sugar than any medicinal
substance, and that most frequently
the sugar counteracts the operation
of the medicine, and is hurtful to the
patient.</p>

<p>Salt communicates an unpleasant
acerbity to substances, hardens the
animal fibre, and renders it difficult of
digestion. It contracts the animal
parenchyma.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> On the other hand, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
it is indispensable to remove, by means
of water, the greater part of the salt
employed; almost all the principles
which are soluble in cold water, are
lost when the salt is taken away: there
remains nothing but the fibrous matter,
or parenchyma; and even that, as has
been said, undergoes a change.</p>

<p>Vinegar can seldom be made use of,
but in the preparation of certain articles
for seasoning.</p>

<p>I shall not enter into any details concerning
what has been said and published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
on the art of preserving alimentary
substances. I shall only observe, that
as far as my knowledge extends, no
author, either ancient or modern, has
ever pointed out, or even led to the
suspicion, of the principle which is the
basis of the method I propose.</p>

<p>It is known, how much, within a
certain period, the public attention,
both at Paris and in the departments,
has been directed towards the means
of diminishing the consumption of sugar,
by supplying its place by the use
of various extracts, or essences, of indigenous
substances. The government,
whose philanthropic views are turned
towards all useful objects, does not
cease to invite all those who pursue the
arts and sciences, to investigate the
means of drawing the utmost advantage
from the productions of our soil, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
order to develope, to the utmost, our
agriculture and manufactures, and so
diminish the consumption of foreign
commodities.</p>

<p>In order to attain the same end, the
Society for the Promotion of National
Industry<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> stimulates, by the offer of
flattering rewards, all those whose talents
and labours are directed towards discoveries,
from which the nation and humanity
may draw substantial benefits.
Animated by this laudable zeal, the
Agricultural Society, by its resolution
of the 21st of June 1809, and its
official notification of it, the 15th of
the July following, made an appeal to
the whole nation, in order to collect all
the information and documents which
might contribute to the composition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a work on the art of preserving, by the
best possible means, every kind of alimentary
substance.</p>

<p>It was after invitations of so great
weight, that I resolved to make known
a method of effecting this object, of
great facility in the execution, and at
the same time very cheap, and which,
by the extension it admits of, may afford
numerous advantages to society.</p>

<p>This method is not a vain theory. It
is the fruit of reflection, investigation,
long attention, and numerous experiments,
the results of which, for more
than ten years, have been so surprising,
that notwithstanding the proof acquired
by repeated practice, that provisions
may be preserved two, three, and six
years, there are many persons who still
refuse to credit the fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Brought up to the business of preserving
alimentary substance by the
received methods; having spent my
days in the pantries, the breweries,
store-houses, and cellars of Champagne,
as well as in the shops, manufactories,
and warehouses of confectioners, distillers,
and grocers; accustomed to
superintend establishments of this kind
for forty-five years, I have been able to
avail myself, in my process, of a number
of advantages, which the greater
number of those persons have not possessed,
who have devoted themselves to
the art of preserving provisions.</p>

<p>I owe to my extensive practice, and
more especially to my long perseverance,
the conviction:</p>

<p>1st. That fire has the peculiar property,
not only of changing the combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the constituent parts of
vegetable and animal productions, but
also of retarding, for many years at
least, if not of destroying, the natural
tendency of those same productions to
decomposition.</p>

<p>2d. That the application of fire in a
manner variously adapted to various substances,
after having with the utmost care
and as completely as possible, deprived
them of all contact with the air, effects
a perfect preservation of those same productions,
with all their natural qualities.</p>

<p>Before I state the details of my
process, I ought to observe that it consists
principally,</p>

<p>1st. In inclosing in bottles the substances
to be preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>2d. In corking the bottles with the
utmost care; for it is chiefly on the
corking that the success of the process
depends.</p>

<p>3d. In submitting these inclosed substances
to the action of boiling water
in a water-bath (<span class="small">BALNEUM MARIAE</span>),
for a greater or less length of time,
according to their nature, and in the
manner pointed out with respect to
each several kind of substance.</p>

<p>4th. In withdrawing the bottles from
the water-bath at the period described.</p>

<p>My laboratory consists of four apartments.
The first of these is furnished
with all kinds of kitchen utensils,
stoves, and other apparatus, necessary
for dressing the animal substances to be
preserved, as well as with a kettle for
broth, gravy, &amp;c. containing 180
French pints, raised on brick work.
This kettle is provided with a pot to be
put within it, pierced with holes like
a skimmer, with divisions for holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
various kinds of meat and poultry.
This pot can be put into and taken out
of the kettle with ease. The kettle is
provided with a wide cock, to which is
fitted, within, a little rose, like that of
a watering-pot, covered with a piece of
boulting-cloth. In this way I can
procure broth or gravy quite clear, and
ready to be put into bottles.</p>

<p>The second apartment is appropriated
to the preparing of milk, cream,
and whey.</p>

<p>The third is used for corking and
tying the bottles and vessels, and putting
them into bags.</p>

<p>The fourth is furnished with three
large copper boilers, placed upon stones
raised on brick work. These boilers
are all furnished with a stout lid, fitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to rest upon the vessels within. Each
boiler is furnished with a wide cock
below, in order to let out the water at a
proper time. These large boilers are
destined to receive, generally, all the
objects intended to be preserved, in order
to apply the action of heat to them
in a suitable manner; and thus they
constitute so many water-baths.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>The utensils which furnish the third
apartment for the preparatory process
consist of</p>

<p>1. Rows of bottle-racks round the
room.</p>

<p>2. A reel for the iron wire, to be
used for binding the necks of the
bottles and other vessels. (<a href="#EXPLANATION_OF_THE_PLATE"><i>Fig. 1.</i></a>)</p>

<p>3. Shears and pincers for tying on
the corks. (<a href="#EXPLANATION_OF_THE_PLATE"><i>Fig. 6.</i></a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Machine for twisting the iron-wire
after it has been divided and cut to a
proper length. (<a href="#EXPLANATION_OF_THE_PLATE"><i>Fig. 2.</i></a>)</p>

<p>5. Two instruments forming a lever,
and used for compressing, and as it
were biting the corks. (<a href="#EXPLANATION_OF_THE_PLATE"><i>Fig. 3.</i></a>)</p>

<p>6. A bottle-boot or block, standing
on three legs, and provided with a
strong bat for corking. (<a href="#EXPLANATION_OF_THE_PLATE"><i>Fig. 5.</i></a>)</p>

<p>7. A stool standing on five legs, for
tying on the corks. (<a href="#EXPLANATION_OF_THE_PLATE"><i>Fig. 4.</i></a>)</p>

<p>8. A sufficient quantity of linen
bags, for covering the bottles and other
vessels.</p>

<p>9. Two stools covered with leather
and stuffed with hay, in order to shake
the bottles upon them, and in that way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
force a greater number of peas and other
small substances into the bottles.</p>

<p>10. A press for the juice of plants,
fruits, and herbs; with pans, vessels,
sieves, and every thing else that belongs
to it.</p>

<p>Besides my laboratory, consisting of
these articles, I have fitted up three
apartments.</p>

<p>The first, for preparing vegetables:
it is furnished with dressers all round.</p>

<p>The second, for storing up and preparing
all kinds of fruit.</p>

<p>The third is a cellar, furnished with
bottle racks, for rinsing and setting by
the bottles and other vessels, as in a
store-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>I have the precaution to keep the
bottles and other vessels I may want,
ready rinsed at hand. I am also supplied
with an assortment of corks, compressed
and bit in the instrument already
described. When every preparation
is thus made, the process is half
done.</p>

<p>The principle by which all alimentary
substances are preserved and kept fresh,
is invariable in its effects. The result in
particular experiments, depends upon
the fitness of each individual application
of the principle to the substance
which is to be preserved, according to
its peculiar qualities; but in every case,
the exclusion of air is a precaution of
the utmost importance to the success of
the operation: and in order to deprive
alimentary substances of contact with
the air, a perfect knowledge of bottles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and the vessels to be used, of corks
and corking, is requisite.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHIII" id="CHIII"></a>§ III.<br />

<span class="small"><i>Of Bottles and Vessels.</i></span></h2>


<p>I chose glass, as being the matter
most impenetrable by air, and have
not ventured to make any experiment
with a vessel made of any other substance.
The ordinary bottles have
generally necks too small and ill made;
they are also too weak to resist the
blows from the bat and the action of the
fire: I, therefore, caused bottles to be
made for my especial use, with wider
necks, and those necks made with a
projecting rim, or ring, on the interior
surface, placed below, and resembling,
in form, the rim which is at the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of the exterior surface of the necks of
bottles. My object was, that when the
cork had been forced into the neck of
the bottle, three-fourths of its length,
in the manner already described, it
should be compressed in the middle.
In this manner the bottle is perfectly
corked on the outside as well as within.
It thus opposes an obstacle to the
swelling, or expansion, which arises
from the operation of heat upon the
substance enclosed within the bottle.
This mode of forming the neck of the
bottle is so much the more indispensable,
as I have repeatedly known the
swelling to be so strong, as to push
out corks of three or four lines in
length, though confined by two iron
wires crossed. The bottles and vessels
should be made of a tough substance
[<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de matière liante</i>], the former having
the weight of twenty-five or twenty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
ounces for each <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litre</i><a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> that the bottle
contains. The glass ought to be
of equal thickness in every part, or it
is liable to break in the water-bath.
The form of the Champagne bottle is
most convenient; it is the handsomest
as well as the strongest, and is of the
best shape for packing up.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHIV" id="CHIV"></a>§ IV.<br />

<span class="small"><i>Of Corks.</i></span></h2>


<p>Economy in corks is generally very
unwise, as in order to save a very trifle
in the price of cork, a risk is incurred
of losing the valuable commodity it is
intended to preserve. As corking is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
made use of in order to preserve and
meliorate certain articles, by depriving
them of all contact with the air,
too much attention cannot be given to
the good quality of the cork, which
should be of eighteen or twenty lines
in length and of the finest quality.
Experience has so fully satisfied me on
this point, that I never make use of
any but superfine corks: these are, in
the end, the cheapest. I further take
the precaution of compressing, and, as
it were, biting the cork, three-fourths
of its length, by means of the instrument
already described (<i>fig. 3</i>), beginning
at the small end. The cork is
rendered more supple; the pores of
the cork are brought closer; it is somewhat
lengthened, and its thickness is
so much diminished at the extremity
which is put into the mouth of the
bottle, that a large cork may be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to enter a very moderate opening.
The action of the heat within the
vessel is such, that the cork swells
within, and the corking is thus rendered
perfect.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHV" id="CHV"></a>§ V.<br />

<span class="small"><i>Of Corking.</i></span></h2>


<p>After what has been just said, the
absolute necessity will be apparent of
having good bottles, with a projecting
rim of equal thickness all round within
the neck. Excellent superfine corks
are also indispensable, which have been
compressed in the instrument three
quarters of their length.</p>

<p>Before I cork, I take care that the
bottles containing liquor are filled only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
up to within three inches of the outer
rim, lest they should burst from the
bubbling and swelling occasioned by
the application of heat to the water.
When the bottles contain vegetables,
fruit, &amp;c. they may be filled up to
within two inches of the rim.</p>

<p>I place the full bottle upon the bottle-boot
already mentioned, before
which I seat myself. This apparatus
is to be supplied with a strong wooden
bat, a small pot full of water, and a
sharp knife, greased with a little suet
or soap, for cutting off the tops of the
corks, which ought never to be raised
much above the head of the bottles.
These arrangements being made, I
place the bottle-boot between my legs,
and taking a cork of fit size, I dip
one half of it into the little pot of
water, in order to facilitate its entrance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and having wiped the end, I then put
it to the mouth of the bottle, at the
same time turning it round. I hold
it in this position with my left hand,
which I keep steady, that the bottle
may stand upright. I take the bat in
my right hand, in order to drive in the
cork by force of blows.</p>

<p>When I find, at the first or second
blow of the bat, that the cork has
somewhat entered, I take my hand from
the cork in order to hold with it the
neck of the bottle, which I fix firmly
and upright upon the bottle-boot; and
by dint of repeated blows, I continue
to drive in my cork three-fourths of its
length. The quarter of the cork which
remains above the bottle, after having
refused to yield any further to the redoubled
blows of the bat, assures me,
in the first place, that the bottle is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
completely corked, and this same residue
serves also to hold the double
crossed iron wire which is necessary to
bind fast the cork, that it may be able
to resist the action of heat on the
water-bath. I must repeat again, that
too much attention cannot be given
to the corking: no circumstance however
minute ought to be neglected, in
order to effect the rigorous exclusion
of the air from the substance to be
preserved; air being a most destructive
agent, and the one which is most sedulously
to be counteracted in the
course of the process.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>The bottles being well stopped up, I
then fasten the cork down with a couple
of iron wires crossed: this is an
easy operation, and any one can do it,
who has once seen it done.</p>

<p>I then put each bottle in a bag of
canvass or coarse linen cloth, made for
the purpose, sufficiently large to wrap
up the whole of the bottle up to the
very cork. These bags are made in
the shape of a muff, open alike at both
ends: one of these ends is drawn with
a string running in a gutter, leaving an
opening of about the width of a crown
piece; the other end is provided with a
couple of small strings, in order to tye
the bag round the neck of the bottle.</p>

<p>By means of these bags, I can dispense
with the use of hay or straw in
packing up the bottles in the water-bath;
and, whenever any one of them
breaks, the fragments are preserved in
the bag. I am spared a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
trouble and a number of inconveniences
which I had formerly to sustain, in
picking up the pieces of the bottle out
of the straw or hay I then made use of.</p>

<p>After having spoken of bottles, their
form and quality; of stoppers, and the
length of the fine cork of which they
ought to be composed; of the corking
and tying; of bags, their form and
utility; I proceed to give an idea of
vessels with large necks, that is, glass
jars, which I make use of for preserving
solid and bulky substances, such as
poultry, game, meat, fish, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These jars have necks of two, three,
or four inches diameter, and are of a
larger or small size; like bottles,
they are furnished with a projecting
rim, not only in order to strengthen
the neck, but also for receiving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
iron wire destined to bind the corks.
I have not yet been able to procure from
the glass-houses a similar projecting
rim in the interior of the neck of these
jars, as I have in that of the bottles.
The completely corking up these vessels,
is, from this circumstance, rendered
more difficult, and demands especial
care.</p>

<p>I met with another obstacle in the
cork itself, from its thinness (more especially
when the cork was very fine),
and also from its ascending pores being
against the grain. I was therefore
obliged to form stoppers of three or
four pieces of cork, from twenty to
twenty-four lines in length, placed together
the way of the grain, the pores
of the cork being placed horizontally,
by means of isinglass prepared in the
following manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>I melted over the fire four drams of
well beaten isinglass, in eight ounces
of water: when melted, I caused it to
run through fine linen; and then put
it again over the fire in order to reduce
it to one third of its volume. After
which I added an ounce of good full-proof
brandy. I then left the whole
on the fire till it became reduced to
about three ounces. I then put the
glue thus prepared in a little pot over
live coals, and took care to warm my
pieces of cork. I then slightly smeared
over the pieces of cork with a brush,
in order to glue them together. When
the pieces composing the stopper were
well fixed and glued together, I then
fixed a tight thread to the two extremities
of the stopper, in order to keep
the pieces together, and let them dry,
either in the sun or in a gentle heat for
about a fortnight. At the end of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
time I took a cork-maker’s knife and
cut my stoppers of a proper shape;
and having always fitted them to the
mouth of the jar, they have never
proved defective.</p>

<p>Having corked my jars, and driven
in the stopper by means of the bat,
the bottles being always placed upright
in the bottle-boot, I made use of a
compound luting. This luting (communicated
to me by Mr. Bardel) is
made of quick lime, which is slaked in
the air by being sprinkled with water,
till it becomes reduced to a powder.
The powder to be kept in this state
in corked bottles ready for use. This
lime mixed with a cheese made of
skimmed milk (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fromage à la pie</i>),
and formed to the thickness of paste,
produces a luting which hardens rapidly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and which withstands the heat of boiling
water.</p>

<p>I besmear the whole of the outside
of the stopper with this luting, and I
cover the edge of the jar with hemp
and strips of linen placed above and
close to the stopper, and hanging down
to the rim.</p>

<p>Farther, that the iron wire may have
force enough to keep down the stopper,
I put a piece of cork seven or eight lines
high, and sixteen or eighteen lines in
diameter, in the middle of the large
stopper which is itself too big to allow
the wire to have any effect upon it.
By means of this second cork, placed
in the middle of the large stopper, I
am able to make the wire take a proper
hold of the cork and give due strength
and solidity to the stopper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>When every thing has thus been
foreseen and prepared, and, above all
things, well corked, tied, and wrapped
up in bags, there remains nothing to
be done, but to apply the preserving
principle, that is, <em>heat</em>, to the substances
duly arranged, and this is the most easy
part of the operation.</p>

<p>I place all the vessels, bottles or jars,
upright in a boiler, which I then fill
with cold water up to the necks of the
vessels; I then cover the boiler with
its lid, which is made to rest upon the
vessels. I cover the upper part of the
lid with a piece of wet linen, in order
that the sides of the lid may exactly
fit, and all evaporation from the water-bath
be impeded as much as possible.</p>

<p>When the boiler has been thus filled
and adjusted, I light the fire beneath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
When the water-bath begins to boil,
I take care to maintain the same degree
of heat for the greater or less quantity
of time required by the substances exposed
to its influence. When this time
has elapsed, I then instantly put out
the fire by means of a coal extinguisher
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étouffoir</i>).</p>

<p>After the fire has been put out a
quarter of an hour, I let out the water
of the bath by means of the cock; after
the water has been withdrawn half an
hour, I uncover the boiler, and I do
not take out the bottles till one or two
hours after the uncovering; and this
terminates the operation.</p>

<p>The next day, or a fortnight afterwards,
for that is immaterial, I place
my bottles on shelves, as I do wine, in
a cool and shady place. If I purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sending them a great distance, I think
it worth while to pitch them before I
place them on the shelves; otherwise
this last operation is not absolutely
necessary. I have now by me, bottles
which have been three years lying under
a stair-case, the substances contained
in which retain as much flavour
as if they were just prepared, and yet
they were never pitched.</p>

<p>We have just seen, from all that
has been said, that alimentary substances,
in order to be preserved, should
be, without exception, subjected to the
application of heat in a water-bath;
after being rigorously excluded from all
contact with the air, in the manner,
and with the precautions already indicated.</p>

<p>The preserving principle is, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
have already observed, invariable in
its effects. Thus every loss I have sustained
from any of the articles being
spoiled, had no other cause than an
erroneous application of the principle,
or some negligence or omission in the
preparatory process already pointed
out. It sometimes happens to me even
now, that my operations do not perfectly
succeed; but no man makes experiments
in any of the arts, or in any
branch of natural philosophy, without
being liable to disappointment. Nor
can any one, therefore, who is employed
in such a process as mine, flatter himself
that he may not sometimes find
his commodities spoiled from some defect
in a vessel, or in the interior of a
cork. But in fact, when due attention
is given, these losses seldom take place.</p>

<span class="small"><i>The means of distinguishing among the
Bottles or Jars, as they are taken
from the Boiler, such of them as,
from some neglect in the preparatory
process, some accident, or the action
of the fire, are in danger of occasioning
a loss, or spoiling the substances
enclosed in them.</i></span></h2>

<p>When the operation is completed, of
whatever kind it may be, I take the
greatest care in my power to examine
all the bottles and jars one by one, as
I take them from the boiler.</p>

<p>I have remarked in some, defects in
the glass, as stars and cracks occasioned
by the action of the heat in the water-bath;
or by the tying, when the mouth
of the vessel has been too weak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>I have observed in others, a moisture
round the stopper, or little spots near
the mouth, from which I inferred that
part of the substance enclosed had oozed
out during the dilation or expansion
produced by the heat of the water-bath:
these are the two principal observations
that usually occur to me: and
whenever I observe either of these
appearances on any bottle, I always
set it aside, and make use of the substance
immediately, that nothing may
be lost.</p>

<p>The first of the flaws pointed out,
arises from the quality, and originally
bad structure of the bottle; but the
second may arise from any one of four
causes:&mdash;1. From a bad cork; 2. from
bad corking; 3. from the bottle having
been filled too near the brim; and 4.
from bad tying. A single one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
faults is sufficient to spoil a bottle;
more easily, therefore, a complication
of them.</p>

<p>In the applying of heat to the water-bath,
I have had various obstacles to
encounter, more particularly when peas
were to be preserved; for peas are of
all substances the most difficult to preserve
completely. This vegetable, when
gathered while it is too young or too tender,
dissolves in water, and in consequence
the bottle is found half empty,
and even this half is not fit to be kept;
hence, whenever this circumstance occurs,
I set aside the bottle and make
use of the article immediately. If the
peas have been gathered two or three
days, the heat occasions them to lose
all their flavour; they become hard;
they ferment before the operation; the
bottles break in the water-bath with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
explosion; those which resist the first
heat break afterwards, or are faulty:
and this is easily recognised by the
liquor in the bottle, which becomes
turbid; while peas which are well preserved,
leave the liquid pellucid.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to recommend dispatch
and the utmost cleanliness in the
preparation of alimentary substances.
This is absolutely indispensable; more
especially in what respects the substances
themselves, which are to be preserved.</p>

<p>I take care to have all my preparatory
arrangements made before I begin the
process; that there may be no waiting,
and that the best use may be made
of the time employed in carrying it on.</p>

<span class="small"><i>Boiled Meat.</i><br />
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pot-au-Feu de Ménage.</i>)</span></h2>


<p>I put a quantity of meat into the
pot to be boiled in the ordinary way.
When it was three-fourths boiled, I
took out one half of it, the bones of
which I had already taken off, as I purposed
to preserve it. When the meat
was completely boiled, I strained the
broth, and after it had become cool, I
put it in bottles which I corked well,
tied and wrapped up in their several
bags. The beef which I had taken out
when three-fourths done, I put into
jars which I filled up with a part of the
same broth. Having corked, luted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and tied up these, and wrapped them in
bags, I placed them, and the bottles
containing the broth, upright in a cauldron
or boiler. I filled this boiler with
cold water up to the rim of the bottles
and jars. I put the lid upon the boiler,
causing it to rest on the vessels within,
and took care to surround it with a wet
linen cloth, in order to impede as much
as possible, any evaporation from the
water-bath. I heated the boiler, and
when the water-bath had been made to
boil, I kept up the same degree of heat
for an hour, and precisely at the end of
the hour, let the fire pass into an extinguisher.
Half an hour afterwards,
I let off the water from the bath, by
means of the cock at the bottom of the
boiler. At the end of another half hour
I took off the lid. An hour or two
afterwards, I took out the bottles and
jars. (The time of doing this is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
immaterial, and the operator will
consult his own convenience.) The
next day I besmeared the corks with
rosin, in order to forward the bottles
and jars to different sea-ports.</p>

<p>At the end of a year, and a year and
half, the broth and boiled meat were
found as good as if made the day they
were eaten.</p>

<span class="small"><i>Gravy.</i></span></h2>


<p>In the year 12, having reason to hope
that I should be employed to provide
some nourishing provisions for the sick
on board his majesty’s vessels, in consequence
of some experiments which
had already been made in the sea-ports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
by order of <em>his Excellency the Minister
of the Marine and Colonies</em>, on alimentary
productions preserved according
to my method; I made the
necessary arrangement for fulfilling the
orders I had reason to expect. In consequence,
that I might not want too
many bottles and jars, and that I might
be able to condense the substance of
eight messes in a bottle of the size of
one <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litre</i>, I made the following experiment.
As, in general, evaporation
cannot take place, but at the expence of
the object to be condensed,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> I made
some gravy, in the proportion of two
pounds of good meat and poultry to
one <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litre</i>. My gravy being made, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
strained and suffered to become cool, I
put it in bottles. After having well
corked, and tied the bottles and wrapped
them in bags, I placed them in the
boiler. I had taken out, when one
quarter dressed, the best pieces of the
beef and poultry. When these were
grown cold, I put them in jars, and filled
the jars with the same gravy. Having
well corked, luted, tied and wrapped up
these jars, I set them upright in the
same boiler with the bottles of gravy.
Having filled the boiler with cold water
up to the rim of the bottles and jars,
and having covered the lid of the boiler
with a wet linen cloth, I heated the
water-bath. When it was made to
boil I kept up the same degree of heat
for two hours, and completed this operation
as I did the preceding.</p>

<p>The beef and fowls were found well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
dressed, and were kept, as well as the
gravy, for more than two years.</p>

<span class="small"><i>Broth, or Jelly.</i></span></h2>


<p>I composed this jelly, according to
the prescription of a physician, of
calves feet and lights, red cabbage, carrots,
turnips, onions, and leeks, taking a
sufficient quantity of each. A quarter
of an hour before I took this jelly from
the fire, I added some sugar-candy
with some Senegal gum. I strained it
as soon as it was made. After it was
cold it was put in bottles, which were
corked, tied, wrapped up in bags, and
put in the water-bath, which was kept
boiling one quarter of an hour, and this
jelly was preserved and remained as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
good as it was the day on which it was
made.</p>

<h2><a name="CHX" id="CHX"></a>§ X.<br />

<span class="small"><i>Round of Beef, Fillet of Mutton,
Fowls and young Partridges.</i></span></h2>


<p>I prepared all these articles as if for
common use, but only three-fourths
dressed, the young partridges being
roasted. When they were grown cold,
I put these articles separately into jars
of a sufficient size. Having well corked,
luted, tied and wrapped them up,
I put them all into the water-bath
which was kept on the boil for half an
hour. They were forwarded to Brest,
and from thence were sent to Sea for
four months and ten days, together
with some vegetables, gravy, and preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
milk, all well packed up in a
chest.</p>

<p>When opened, eighteen different
kinds of preserved food were tasted,
every one of which had retained its
freshness; and not a single substance
had undergone the least change at Sea.</p>

<p>To the experiments made with these
four kinds of provisions, I can add two
others made by myself; the one, a
fricasee of fowls; and the other, a matelot
of eels, carp, and pike, with an
addition of sweet-bread, mushrooms,
onions, butter, and anchovies, all dressed
in white wine. The fricasee and the
matelot were perfectly preserved.</p>

<p>These results prove sufficiently that
the same principle, applied with the
same preparatory process, and with the
same care and precautions, in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
preserves all animal productions. But
it is to be observed that in the previous
cooking of each articles, it is to be only
three-fourths dressed at the utmost,
in order that the remainder of the requisite
cooking may be communicated
by means of the water-bath.</p>

<p>There are a number of articles which
can bear an additional hour of boiling
in the water-bath without any danger,
as broth, gravy, jellies and the essences
of meat, poultry and ham, the juice of
the grape and of plants, &amp;c. But
there are also others which will sustain
a great injury from a quarter of an
hour’s or even a minute’s too much
boiling. Thus the result will always
depend upon the dexterity, intelligence
and judgment of the operator.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<span class="small"><i>New-laid Eggs.</i></span></h2>


<p>The more fresh the egg is, the longer
it withstands the heat of the water-bath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
I consequently took eggs the day they
had been laid, placed them in a jar,
with raspings of bread, to fill up the
vacuities, and secure them against
breaking when removed to a distance.
Having well corked, tied and luted the
jars, &amp;c. I placed them in a boiler of
a proper size<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> to give them seventy-five
degrees of heat.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> Having taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the water-bath from the fire, I took
out the eggs as soon as the water was
so cool that I could put my finger in it.
I then took out the eggs and kept them
six months. At the end of that period
I took the eggs out of the jar, put them
into cold water which I set on the fire,
and heated it to seventy-five degrees: I
found them fit to dip a toast of bread
into, and as fresh as when I prepared
them. As to hard eggs, which are to
be cut into slices and fricaseed, I heat
the water-bath eighty degrees, and as
soon as it begins to boil, I remove the
water-bath from the fire.</p>

<span class="small"><i>Milk.</i></span></h2>


<p>I took twelve <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litres</i> of milk fresh from
the cow; I condensed it in the water-bath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and reduced it to two-thirds of its
volume, frequently skimming it. Then
I strained it through a boulting cloth.
When cold I took from it the skim
which had risen while it was cooling,
and bottled it, with the usual process,
and afterwards put it in the water-bath
which I let boil for two hours; and at
the end of several months, I perceived
that the cream had separated itself and
was swimming in the bottle in the
form of flakes. To obviate this inconvenience,
I made a second experiment
on a like quantity of milk which I condensed
in the water-bath, reducing it
to one half, instead of one third, as I had
done the former. I then added to the
milk, so reduced, the yolks of eight
new laid eggs well beaten. Having
left the whole thus well mingled half
an hour on the fire, I completed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
experiment as before. This expedient
perfectly succeeded.</p>

<p>The yolk of egg had so completely
combined all the particles, that at the
end of a year, and even of eighteen
months, the milk remained as fresh as
when I put it in the bottles. The first
also was preserved more than two years.
The cream which was in flakes disappeared
when put on the fire. Both
sustained the boiling alike. From
both, butter and whey were afterwards
obtained. In the different experiments
and chymical analyses to which they
were exposed, it was found that the
last, being much the better, was equal
to the best cream sold at Paris to drink
with coffee.</p>

took off the skim which was formed

it in half bottles, observing the usual
process, and let the water-bath boil for
one hour.</p>

<span class="small"><i>Whey.</i></span></h2>


<p>I prepared some whey by the ordinary
process. When clarified, and grown
cold, I put it in bottles, &amp;c. and let it
remain in the water-bath which was
boiling one hour. However well the
whey may be clarified, when put into
the water-bath, the application of the
heat always detaches some particles of
cheese which are deposited. I preserved
some in this way two and three years,
and before I made use of it, I strained
it that it might be very clear. On an
emergency you may content yourself
with carefully decantering the whey for
this purpose.</p>

the productions of different countries
more or less early, and varies their
qualities, kinds and denominations,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>

to the circumstances of the spot in

<p>At Paris and its environs, June and
July are the best months for preserving
green peas (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits pois verts</i>), small
windsor beans (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petites fèves de marais</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and asparagus (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">asperge</i>). At a later period,
these vegetables suffer greatly from
heat and dryness. In August and September
I preserve artichokes (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artichauts</i>),
French beans (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haricots verts et
blancs</i>), and cauliflowers (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">choux-fleurs</i>).</p>

<p>In general, all vegetables intended
to be preserved should be used as recently
gathered as possible, and prepared
with the utmost rapidity, so that
there should be as it were, but one step
from the garden-bed to the water-bath.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clamart</i> and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crochu</i> are the
two kinds of peas which I prefer, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the latter, which is the most
juicy and sweet of all, as well as the
earliest, except the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">michaux</i> (hastings),
which is the first pea, but this kind is
not fit to be preserved. I gather the
peas when they are not too young and
tender, for they are apt to dissolve in
water during the operation. I take
them when they are of a middling size.
They are then in a more perfect state,
and have an infinitely finer taste and
flavour. I shell them as soon as they
are gathered. I separate the large ones,
and they are then put in bottles, the
bottles being for that purpose placed on
the stool before mentioned, in order
that as many peas as possible may, by
shaking the bottle, be made to go into
them; I then cork the bottles, &amp;c. and
put them in the water-bath, which is
made to boil for an hour and half, if
the season be cool and moist; and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
hours in a dry and hot season; and I
terminate the operation as before.</p>

<p>I also put in bottles the larger peas
which I had separated from those which
were more delicate. These, also, I put
into the water-bath, which I let boil
according to the season, two hours, or
two hours and an half.</p>

gather it very small, about the size of
the end of the little finger, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>

becomes brown when in contact with
the air, I take the precaution of putting
the beans in bottles as soon as
shelled. When the bottles are full,
the beans having been shaken down
gently on the stool, and in that way
the vacancies in the bottle having been
filled up, I add to each bottle a little
bunch of savory; I cork them quickly

greenish colour; on the contrary, when

bottles. I then cork the bottles and
put them in the water-bath, which is

be soon obvious, that it is necessary to
study and adapt the various degrees of
heat required according to the season.
Attention to this circumstance must
never be disregarded. For instance,
in a cool and damp year, vegetables
are more tender and consequently more
sensible to the action of fire. In this
case, the water-bath should be made
to boil seven or eight minutes less; and
in dry seasons, when vegetables are
firmer, and better support the action
of fire, seven or eight minutes boiling
should be added.</p>

together in a copper vessel well tinned.
These vegetables ought to be well stewed,
as if for daily use, and not dried up and
burned as is often done in families,
when it is intended to preserve them.
This quantity of stewing is the most
fit. When my herbs are thus prepared,
I set them to cool in earthen or stone
vessels. Afterwards I put them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
bottles with a wide mouth. I cork
them, &amp;c. and I put my sorrel in the
water-bath, which is allowed a quarter
of an hour’s boiling merely. This time
is sufficient for preserving it ten years
untouched, and as fresh as if it was
just taken from the garden. This mode
is, without dispute, the best and most
economical for families and hospitals,
civil and military. It is, above all,
most advantageous to the Navy: for

I was forced to have recourse
to sugar: in consequence, I squeezed
some strawberries, and strained them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
through a sieve, as if I were about to
make ice. I added half a pound of
powder sugar, with the juice of half a
lemon, to a pound of strawberries. I
mixed the whole together, and put the
decoction in bottles which I corked, &amp;c.
I exposed it to a water-bath till it
began to boil, &amp;c. This mode succeeded
very well, in every respect, except
the colour, which was considerably
faded; but that may be supplied.</p>

<p>For the table, the wild and garden
apricot (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’abricot commun, et l’abricot

free in the open air, are the best kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
for preservation: I commonly mingle
these two kinds together, because the
former supports the latter, which has
more sugar in it, and which dissolves
more from the action of heat. They
may nevertheless be prepared apart,
provided the precaution be taken, of
letting the garden peach remain a few
minutes less in the water-bath than the
wild peach. That is, as soon as the
water-bath begins to boil, the fire is to
be taken away from the garden peach,
while the fire may be allowed to remain
under the wild peach until the water-bath
completely boils.</p>

<p>I gather the apricots when they are
ripe, but somewhat firm; when, on
being squeezed gently between the fingers,
the stone is perceived to detach
itself from the fruit. As soon as gathered,
I cut them in halves, take out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>

them into bottles, either in halves or

I cork them and put them into the

<p>I have made prunes of whole green-gages,
including the stone and the stalk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
as well as of other great plums; and
even of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdrigons</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">alberges</i>, which
succeeded very well. But there are
these inconveniences in preserving the
largest fruits whole, that few of these
large plums can be put into even a
large jar, since the vacancies cannot be
filled up by shaking the fruit, without
altogether crushing them; and that
when the heat of the water-bath is applied
to them, they shrink, and the
jars are found half empty.</p>

<p>In consequence, I have abandoned
this too expensive mode, and am accustomed
to preserve all these large
plums, cut in halves, after having taken
out the stone. This is the easiest
and most economical manner, corks of
a sufficiently large size for large objects
being very dear, and also rare, when
the cork is very fine; the vessels too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>

are more easy to be well corked, and
the operation is in consequence more
certain. As to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mirabelle</i> [a small
white plum] and all other small plums,
I prepare them with the stone in them,
after having taken off the stalk; for
they are in this way easier to shake
close, and they leave but few vacancies
in the bottles. In general, I observe,
in the preservation of all these prunes,
either whole or cut in halves, the same

<span class="small"><i>Meat, Game, Poultry, Fish.</i></span></h2>


<p>Meat which has in the preparatory
dressing, as well as the boiling it received
in the water-bath, received its
due quantity of cooking, will, when it is
taken to be used, require only to be properly
warmed in order to produce both
soup and meat (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potage et bouilli</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>For the sake of greater economy, and
to lessen the number of bottles and
jars wanted, it is better to make in the
first instance a good gravy as already
pointed out by me. For both the beef
and the gravy need only to be warmed,
and by adding one half or two-thirds
of water to the gravy a good soup is
provided.</p>

<p>In this manner, a bottle containing a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litre</i> of gravy may, by adding two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litres</i>
of boiling water to it at the moment
that it is to be used, and adding a little
salt, furnish a dozen good messes. Thus
it is easy at a very slight expence to
keep a little stock of provisions against
an emergency and hot weather, when
it is so difficult to procure them, more
especially in the country.</p>

<p>All meat, poultry, game, and fish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which have received three-fourths of
their dressing in the preparatory process,
and the remainder in the water-bath,
as already pointed out, may, when
taken out of the vessels, be heated to
the proper degree in order to be instantly
served at table. If, for instance,
the substance taken from the bottle or
jar, had not received either enough
previous dressing, or enough heat from
the water-bath; it is immediately put
on the fire in order to supply what is
deficient. Consequently, when the
operator has taken due care in making
his preparations, having properly seasoned
and dressed them, the use to be
made of them afterwards, will at all
events be easy and convenient; for on
the one hand they will need only to
be warmed, and on the other hand,
they may, if necessary, be eaten cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Substances thus prepared and preserved,
do not, as might be imagined,
require to be consumed as soon as they
are opened. Provisions may be used
from a vessel eight or ten days after it
has been uncorked,<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> care being taken

<span class="small"><i>Peas, Beans, &amp;c.</i></span></h2>


<p>Green peas are dressed in various
ways. If they are ill cooked in the
season, it is the cook who is blamed;
but if they are not found good in winter,
the fault is thrown on the person who
has preserved them, though the fault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
most frequently arises from some of the
substances employed; either from the
bad butter, or the oil or rancid fat
which is made use of through negligence
or economy. At another time
they are prepared two hours too soon.
They are suffered to stick to the bottom
of the saucepan when on the fire, and
they are served smelling of the butter
which is turned into oil with a burnt
taste; or they are prepared without
care and with too much precipitation. It
is thus we see green peas brought to the
table swimming in water; but every
one has his way. The following is
mine.</p>

<p>As soon as the peas have been washed
and immediately afterwards drained
(for neither this vegetable nor the
windsor-bean must be suffered to remain
in water, for that would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
away their flavour), I put them on the
fire in a saucepan with a morsel of good
fresh butter. I add to them a bunch
of parsley and chives. After having
tossed them several times in butter, I
dredge them with a little flour, and
moisten them immediately afterwards
with boiling water up to the level of the
peas. I leave them thus to be boiled a
good quarter of an hour, until very little
sauce remains. Then I season them
with salt and a little pepper, and leave
them on the fire until they are stewed
down; I then take them off the fire
immediately, in order to add a piece
of fresh butter as large as a nut, with
a table spoonful of powder sugar for
each bottle of peas. I toss them well
without replacing them on the fire,
until the butter is melted, and I serve
them up in the shape of a pyramid
upon a dish, which I take care to warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thoroughly. I have observed several
times, that by adding sugar to the peas
when upon the fire, and giving them
only one boiling, the peas became hard
and the sauce ran so that it could no
longer bind the peas together. Thus
great attention should be given to the
not putting in the sugar and the last piece
of butter until the moment of serving
them up. This is the only way of
dressing them well, for neither in
summer nor winter ought any sauce
to appear among the peas.</p>

<p>There is another mode of eating
green peas and which may suit many
persons; this consists in simply boiling
the peas in water. When done, the
water is drained off and the peas are
tossed with a piece of good fresh butter,
salt, pepper and sugar, all together over
a very gentle fire, they are then served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
up directly upon a very hot dish. Care
must be taken that the peas do not boil
with the seasoning, otherwise the butter
turns into oil, and the green peas are
dissolved in the water.</p>

<p>I cook the small windsor-beans, as well
with as without their skin, by the same
process and with the same attentions
which I observe in dressing green peas.</p>

<p>I make an excellent soup-maigre,
with large preserved peas which are
equally good for a meat soup. As to
asparagus, artichokes, cauliflowers, &amp;c.
they are dressed in the usual way after
having been washed, &amp;c. Green peas,
beans, French beans, and all kinds of
vegetables may be three-fourths boiled,
seasoned at the same time, as is done
when intended for immediate use, put
into bottles or other vessels when cool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
corked, &amp;c. and allowed one half
hour’s boiling in the water-bath. By
these means vegetables will be preserved
and quite ready, which may be made
use of in an instant, without any other
care than to warm them; and there are
also many instances in which these
vegetables may be eaten cold. In this
way all difficulties may be removed in
travelling by land or water.</p>

<p>The manner of making use of fruits,
preserved by the process I have pointed
out, consists, 1st. in putting such
fruit into a fruit jar, in the same state
in which it is in the bottle, without
adding any sugar, because many persons,
more especially ladies, prefer
fruits with their natural juice. At the
same time I prepare another jar with a
preserve of grape-syrup or powder
sugar, for those who prefer it. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
from experience learnt that grape-syrup
preserves the aroma and agreeable acidity
of fruits, much better than sugar.
This is a very simple and economical
mode of preparing an excellent dish of
preserved fruits, which is the more convenient,
as every one can satisfy his

four ounces of grape syrup. As soon
as it begins to boil, I withdraw it from
the fire, and take off the froth by
means of a piece of brown paper,
which I apply to the surface. As soon
as I have skimmed it, I take the fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
gently off the syrup, in order to put it
into a fruit-jar. After having reduced
the syrup one half over the fire, I put
it upon the fruit in the jar. Fruits thus
preserved are sufficiently sweet, and
have as fine a flavour as a preserve
made in the season with fresh fruits.</p>

<p>3d. In order to preserve in brandy
either cherries, apricots, green-gages,
pears, peaches, mirabelles, &amp;c. (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compotes
à l’eau de vie</i>), I take a pound
of preserved fruit, together with its
juice, which I put in a saucepan, on
the fire, together with a quarter of a
pound of grape syrup. When ready
to boil, I skim it; after which, I gently
take the fruit from off the syrup, and
put it in a jar. I leave the syrup on
the fire, till it is reduced to one-fourth of
its bulk. Then I take it from the fire
in order to add to it a glass of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
brandy; and having mixed the whole,
I pour the hot syrup upon the fruit in
the jar, which I take care to close well
that the fruit may be better penetrated
by the syrup, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The preserved pear and peach may
be alike made use of to make a Burgundy
wine conserve with cinnamon,
as well as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compotes grillées</i>.</p>

<p>4th. I make a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marmelade</i>, either of
apricots, peaches, green-gages, or mirabelles,
by the following process. I
take for one pound of preserved fruit,
half a pound of grape syrup. I boil
the whole together over a quick fire,
taking care to stir it well with a spoon
to prevent its boiling. When the marmelade
is boiled to a slight consistency,
I take it off, because the confectionary
which is the least boiled is the best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
As preserved fruits afford a facility of
making confectionary just when it is
wanted, they may, by a little boiling
only, be had at any time, fresh and of
excellent quality.</p>

<span class="small"><i>Currant Jam.</i></span></h2>


<p>The mode of making currant jam
with the juice of this preserved fruit,
is quite simple. I put half a pound
of sugar to one pound of currant juice,
which ought to be perfumed with a
little raspberry. Having clarified and
dissolved my sugar, I put the currant
juice to it, and give it three or four
boilings; and when it falls from the
skimmer in small lumps not larger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a lentil, I take it from the fire to put it

<span class="small"><i>Syrup of Currants.</i></span></h2>


<p>In order to make syrup of currants,
I warm the juice of this fruit till it is
ready to boil. I then strain it through
a cloth. By these means I obtain the
juice, limpid, and freed from its mucillage.
When strained, I add half a
pound of grape syrup to a pound of
fruit, and put the whole on the fire together;
when boiled to the consistence
of a slight syrup, I take it from the
fire to put it in bottles when it is
cold.</p>

<p>There is a very simple and economical
mode of making use, not only of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
currant juice, but that of all fruits
which are employed to compose an acid
beverage.</p>

<p>This mode consists merely in putting
into a glass of water slightly sweetened
with grape syrup, a table spoonful of
the juice of preserved currant, or of
any other fruit that may be at hand,
which is poured into another glass and
then drank off. This mode is the more
convenient, because it will be always
easy to have these preserved juices at
hand, or to procure them at a small expence.
In this way my family has
been, for the space of fifteen years, in
the habit of making use of currant
juice; and most frequently we prepare
this substitute for lemonade, without
either sugar or syrup.</p>

<p>I have prepared and made, in the

season, ices of currants, raspberries,

preserved in the manner pointed
out by me.</p>

<p>I made these experiments before the
late improvement in the art of making
grape syrup, but now that this production
has been brought nearly to perfection,
the syrup of the acid grape
manufactured by Mr. Privat of Meze,
will soon advantageously supply the
place of the juice of the sugar cane,
in the preparation of the ices of fruit.
As I have already observed, the grape
syrup preserves the aroma of all fruits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
better than sugar. Sugar overpowers
to so great a degree the taste of
the fruits, that it is necessary to add
some lemons to the ices of fruits, in
order, as it were, to bring out the
aroma. When therefore the juice of
an acid grape shall be made use of, the
lemons will become unnecessary, and
the ices of fruit will be the richer.
The sweet syrups of the grape will be
successfully made use of with all ice-creams.</p>

and sweetened with grape syrup. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
preparations yielded in nothing to the
best home-made liqueurs.</p>

<p>The simple and easy modes which I
have pointed out, of preparing every
kind of preserved fruit for daily use,
prove sufficiently that this method, as
sure as it is useful, will introduce the
greatest economy in the consumption
of the produce of the sugar-cane.
The consumer, and more especially the
manufacturer, who is obliged to lay in
during summer, a considerable stock of
this foreign commodity for syrups,
liqueurs and confectionary, as well as
all the objects of pharmacy, may dispense
with it; for it will be sufficient
if they lay in an adequate stock of fruit
in the season, and prepare it in the
manner pointed out, to be exempt from
the necessity of preparing it with sugar,
except on an emergency, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the quantities actually wanted. It will
follow that the greater part of all these
fruits will be preserved, altogether
without, or at least with a small quantity
of sugar; that many of them will
be prepared with grape syrup, and that
the sugar from the cane will be made
use of only for indispensable objects,
or to comply with the old habits, and
gratify the luxury of a few.</p>

<p>It will follow, that in a plentiful
year, sugar will not be necessary in
order to provide against a scanty season;
and that, with a slight expence,
the same enjoyment will be derived
from the preserved produce of two,

<span class="small"><i>Grape Juice, or Must.</i></span></h2>


<p>When I made my first experiments
of preserving grape juice in its fresh
state, I was unacquainted with Mr.
Parmentier’s “<cite>Information concerning
the means of furnishing a substitute
for sugar, in the principal uses made of
it in medicine and domestic economy</cite>.”<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a>
It is this valuable information which
supplied me with the means of availing
myself of fresh experiments, and
making use of two hundred bottles of
grape-juice preserved by me six months
before.</p>

<p>1st. I made very good grape syrup,
following the process of Mr. Parmentier,
which is literally as follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Preparation of Grape Syrup.</i></p>

<p>“You take twenty-four [French]
pints of grape juice and put one half
of it in a boiler placed on the fire, with
the precaution of not suffering it to
boil with too much force. You add
fresh juice as that in the boiler evaporates;
you skim it and stir the surface,
to add to the evaporation. When the
whole of the juice has been put into
the boiler, you skim it, you take the
boiler off the fire, and add some lye-ashes
tied up in a cloth, or whiting
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blanc d’Espagne</i>, Spanish, or Troy-white),
or chalk reduced to a powder,
and first diluted in a little grape juice,
until it no longer effervesces, or, as
it were, boils in the liquor which was
shaken.</p>

<p>“By these means, the acid contained
in the grape, is separated and neutralized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
In order to try the liquor,
put blue paper into it, and when it does
not turn red, then you may be satisfied
that the liquor is no longer acid. Replace
the boiler on the fire, after having
let it settle an instant, and put in two
whites of beaten eggs. Strain the
liquor through a woollen cloth, fixed
on a wooden frame of twelve or fifteen
square inches, so that it occupies little
room; then boil again, and continue the
evaporation.</p>

<p>“In order to know whether the
syrup be sufficiently condensed, let
some drop from a spoon upon a plate:
if the drop falls without spirting or
spreading, or if when divided, the
halves run into each other again but
slowly, then you may infer that it has
acquired the proper consistency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pour it into an earthen vessel which
is not varnished; and when completely
cold, transfer it to vessels of a moderate
size, neat, dry, and well corked; and
placed it in the cellar. A bottle once
opened, should not remain long only
half filled; and when you make use of
it, take care to hold the neck downwards.</p>

<p>“It is hardly possible to determine
precisely, the quantity of chalk or
ashes necessary to be used. Less is
required in the South than in the
North, but at all events, more than is
necessary will do no harm, since it
remains upon the straining cloth with
the other insoluble salts and the
skim.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p>“If in order to preserve these
syrups for a longer time, you were to
carry on the boiling too long, you
would find yourself mistaken; for the
syrup would not fail to chrystalize at
the bottom of the vessel, while the
body would become thin: on the other
hand, if the syrup were not sufficiently
evaporated, it would soon ferment. A
housekeeper who has made these syrups
twice, will have learnt the degree of
boiling which ought to be given to the
syrup, better than can be taught her
by rule.”</p>


<p><i>Syrups and Ratafies.</i></p>

<p>With this same syrup, I have prepared
preserves, confectionary, syrups
and beverages, as well as liqueurs and
ratafies of all the kinds of fruit I have
spoken of.</p>

<p>2d. I made syrup of the same
grape juice and by the same process,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
except that I boiled the latter but
slightly, that is, one quarter less than
the former; as I wished to satisfy myself
whether it would be preserved by
the application of heat to the water-bath,
in the way before pointed out.
Having prepared my syrup, I put it
when cold, into three half bottles;
one full, and the other a quarter
empty. I corked and sealed the bottles,
and let them remain in the water-bath
only till it boiled, &amp;c. I remarked
no difference in the full and
half full bottles, and all three were
completely preserved.</p>

<p>3d. I took six pints of preserved
grape juice, to which I added two pints
of good old proof brandy, and also
two pounds of grape syrup, which I had
prepared. This preparation which I
mixed well, I made use of to compose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
four kinds of liqueur, by means of infusions
of apricot-kernels, mint, orange
flower, badian, which I had prepared
before: these liqueurs having been
well strained, were found very good,
and sufficiently sweet.</p>

<p>4th. I took two bottles of preserved
grape juice, which I poured into two
other fit bottles. I corked and tied
these bottles, and left them standing
upright ten days. During this interval,
the liquor caused its cork to burst,
like the best Champagne wine, and
mantled in the same way.</p>

<p>5th. I repeated this last experiment
in the same manner. At the end of
twelve or fifteen days, observing no
appearance of fermentation in the bottles,
I uncorked them in order to let
in the air, and I then put into them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
table spoonful of preserved raspberry
juice. Having re-corked and sealed
them, I let them remain eight days
longer upright. At the end of that
time, both the white and the red juice
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le blanc et le rosé</i>) caused the cork to
spring out. They mantled completely,
and were very agreeable to the taste,
particularly the red, perfumed with
raspberry.</p>

<p>After these experiments made of the
<em>Massy</em> grape [in the department of
<em>Seine and Oise</em>], it is more than probable
that in the fine vineyards of the
South, infinitely more precious results
will be drawn from the making use of
this method. Grape juice will be preserved
there, in order, by congelation,
to reduce it at will, to the consistence
of syrup, after having taken away its
acid for the sweet syrup; or if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
juice be condensed over the fire, the
quantity of boiling made use of for
condensing the syrup, will, by the
operation of heat in the water-bath in
any preparatory process, be rendered
immaterial for the preservation of the
syrup for several years.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<p>By means of this process, which is
easy to be put in practice, and of little
expence in the execution, syrups may
be obtained clear and white (even when
produced from black grapes), and of
a pure sweetness, free from a certain
flavour of molasses and burnt sugar,
from which it has not hitherto been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
found possible to exempt grape syrup,
when boiled in the ordinary mode, sufficient
for its preservation.</p>

<p>Thus this precious production, preserved
in bottles and vessels of every
size, may be transported to a great distance
and in all seasons, coming from
Bergerac, Mèze, and all the manufactories
of the South, to improve the
produce of our small vineyards, and
make all classes of society share in the
enjoyment of this useful resource.</p>

<h2><a name="CHLVIII" id="CHLVIII"></a>§ LVIII.<br />
<span class="small"><i>General Observations.</i></span></h2>


<p>From this detail of experiments, it is
obvious that this new method of preserving
animal and vegetable substance,
proceeds from the simple principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
applying heat in a due degree to the
several substances, after having deprived
them as much as possible of all
contact with the external air.</p>

<p>It might on the first view of the
subject be thought that a substance,
either raw or previously acted upon by
fire, and afterwards put into bottles,
might, if a vacuum were made in those
bottles and they were completely corked,
be preserved equally well with the
application of heat in the water-bath.
This would be an error, for all the trials
I have made have convinced me that
the absolute privation of the contact of
external air (the internal air being
rendered of no effect by the action of
heat), and the application of heat by
means of the water-bath, are both indispensable
to the complete preservation
of alimentary substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>My object is not like that of the
Bourdeaux chymists, to disunite the
component parts of the animal substance,
and obtain the animal jelly in a
separate state, as well as the animal
fibre, free from its juice, and so made
to resemble tanned leather. Neither is
it my endeavour to furnish at a great
expence, as in the preparation of portable
soup, a tenacious paste or glue,
better adapted to derange the stomach
than to provide it with a salutary nourishment.</p>

<p>My problem is, to preserve all nutritive
substances with all their peculiar
and constituent qualities. My experiments
prove that I have resolved this
problem.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>It is to the solution of this problem
that I have devoted my fortune and
twenty years of labour and meditation.
Happy that I have already been able
to render service to my fellow citizens
and humanity, I rely on the justice, generosity
and intelligence of a wise government,
which never fails to encourage
useful discoveries. That government
will perceive that the inventor
of this method of preservation could
not obtain from the invention itself an
indemnification for his labour and expence.
The chief importance of this
process lies in its subservience to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
wants of civil and military hospitals,
and particularly of the Navy. It is in
these departments of the public service
that my process may be employed in a
manner advantageous to the state, and
it is from them that I may receive the
just reward of my labours. I expect
every thing from the beneficent views
of the minister, and my expectations
will not be disappointed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHLIX" id="CHLIX"></a>§ LIX.<br />
<span class="small"><i>Practical Remarks.</i></span></h2>


<p>The bottles and other vessels of every
kind fit for the preservation of alimentary
substances will occasion but a very
slight expence at one time. They may
be always used again, if care be taken to
rince them as soon as they are empty;
good corks, string and wire are not expensive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
As soon as the method is
known, proper bottles and jars will be
met with at the manufacturers, corks of
every size and properly prepared for use
will be furnished by the cork-cutters, as
well as iron-wire fit for use.</p>

<p>It will be always adviseable to procure
corks before bottles, and in that
case no other bottles need be purchased
than such as may have necks suited to
the size of the corks, for I have been
often unable to procure corks of such
a size as I could wish.</p>

<p>The glass-houses of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Garre</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sèves</i>,
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des Prémontrés</i> near <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Courcy-le-Château</i>,
are already accustomed to the
manufactory of corks and jars necessary
for the preserving process. I am most
satisfied with the latter, which has
served me for the last four years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Good corking depends only on a little
practice. It will suffice to cork a dozen
bottles with care and exactness, in
order to familiarize a person with the
method. Every day, wine and liquors
are bottled and transported by land and
water to the remotest places. Even
glass vessels containing from forty to
eighty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litres</i> in measure have been sent
to a great distance full of oil of vitriol
and other liquids. It will be the same
with animal and vegetable productions,
preserved in glass bottles or jars, when
sufficient care and attention shall be
given them. This is the principal
thing required. How many rich liquors
and other substances would be
better preserved which are either lost or
spoiled for want of being well corked!</p>

<p>No one will doubt, after all the experiments
I have detailed, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
adoption of this new method, which,
as may be seen, unites the greatest
economy to a perfection unlooked for
till the present time, will secure the
following advantages.</p>

<p>1. That of considerably diminishing
the consumption of sugar, the produce
of the cane, and of giving the
greatest extension to the manufactories
of grape syrup.</p>

<p>2. That of preserving for use in all
countries and all seasons, a number of
alimentary and medicinal productions,
which being very abundant in some
places at certain seasons, are therefore
wasted, being considered as of no value;
while the same substances, under other
circumstances, being much wanted, become
of double and even four-fold value;
and sometimes cannot be procured at
any price, such as butter and eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>3. That of procuring for civil and
military hospitals, and even for the
armies the most valuable assistance,
the details of which would be superfluous
here. But the great advantage
of this method consists principally in
its application to the service of the
Navy. It will supply fresh and wholesome
provisions for his majesty’s vessels
on long voyages with a saving of more
than fifty per cent. Mariners will in
case of illness be furnished with broth,
various and cooling beverages, vegetables
and fruits; in a word, they will
be able to partake of a number of
alimentary and medicinal substances,
which will alone be sufficient to prevent
or cure the diseases contracted at
Sea, more especially the worst of them
all, the scurvy. These advantages
eminently merit the public attention
when we reflect that salted provisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and, above all, their bad qualities, have
caused the loss of more lives at Sea
than shipwrecks and naval engagements.</p>

<p>4. Medicine will find in this method
the means of relieving humanity,
by the facility of meeting every where,
and in all seasons, animal substances,
and all kinds of vegetables, as well as
their juices, preserved with all their
natural qualities and virtues: by the
same means it will obtain resources infinitely
precious in the production of
distant regions, preserved in their fresh
state.</p>

<p>5. From this method will arise a
new branch of industry, relative to the
productions of France, by their circulation
through the interior, and the exportation
abroad, of the produce with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
which nature has blessed the different
countries.</p>

<p>6. This method will facilitate the
exportation of the wine of many vineyards:
wine which can scarcely be kept
a year, even when not removed from
the spot, may hereafter be preserved
many years though sent abroad.</p>

<p>Finally, this invention cannot fail to
enlarge the domain of Chymistry, and
become the common benefit of all
countries, which will derive the most
precious fruits from it.</p>

<p>So many advantages, and an infinity
of others which the imagination of the
reader will easily conceive, produced
by one and the same cause, are a source

<p class="blockquot">THE SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY FOR
THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF NATIONAL
INDUSTRY, TO MR. APPERT, PROPRIETOR
AT MASSY.</p>

<p><i>Sir</i>,</p>

<p><i>I have the pleasure to transmit
to you a copy of the Report made
to the</i> Société d’Encouragement, <i>by
Messrs. Guyton-Morveau, Parmentier,
and Bouriat, on your preserved vegetable
and animal substances. Nothing
can be added to the judgment passed
by the Committee upon your discovery.
They announce, that it has not been in
their power to make any experiments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
either sufficiently exact, or continued
for a sufficient length of time, to enable
them to verify to what extent the substances
prepared by you may be preserved;
but what they have themselves
observed, suffices to enable them to form
an opinion to which they were previously
disposed, by the numerous and decisive
testimonies which attest your
success.</i></p>

<p><i>The Society are of opinion that
they are rendering a service to the
country and humanity, when they
make known so useful a discovery
with the eulogies which it merits.
Their desire will be accomplished,
should their suffrage determine the
public to make use of your productions,
and so contribute to confer
upon you the just rewards of your
labours.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Accept, Sir, the assurance of the
perfect respect with which I have
the honour to salute you.</i></p>

<p class="mt2 blockquot">EXTRACT FROM THE PROCÈS-VERBAL
OF THE SITTING OF THE COUNCIL OF
ADMINISTRATION, WEDNESDAY, 15TH
MARCH, 1809.</p>


<p class="blockquot"><i>Report made by Mr. Bouriat, in the
name of a Special Committee, on
Vegetable and Animal Substances,
preserved by</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Appert</span>.</p>

<p>The council referred to a committee,
consisting of Messrs. Guyton-Morveau,
Parmentier, and myself, the examination
of vegetable and animal substances
presented by Mr. Appert, and
preserved by his process, for more than
eight months.</p>

<p>These substances were,</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<ul><li>1. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pot-au-feu</i> [a standing French dish of boiled meat, fowls, &amp;c.]</li>
<li>2. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Consommé</i>, gravy.</li>
<li>3. Milk.</li>
<li>4. Whey.</li>
<li>5. Green Peas.</li>
<li>6. Small Windsor Beans.</li>
<li>7. Cherries.</li>
<li>8. Apricots.</li>
<li>9. Currant Juice.</li>
<li>10. Raspberries.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these articles was contained
in an earthen vessel hermetically sealed,
the cork being fastened with iron
wire and pitched. Proceeding methodically
in our enquiry:</p>

<p>We found in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pot-au-feu</i> a jelly
tolerably rich, with a piece of beef and
two pieces of fowl in the middle.
Warming the whole with care, to a
suitable degree, the soup was found
good, and the meat which was separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
from it, very tender, and of an
agreeable flavour.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">consommé</i> appeared to us to be
excellent; and though prepared fifteen
months before, there was scarcely
any discernible difference between its
then state, and what it would have been,
if made fresh the same day.</p>

<p>The <i>milk</i> was found to be of a yellowish
colour, resembling that of colostrum
or beestings, more thick, as well as
sweeter and more savoury than the ordinary
milk: a superiority it derives
from the concentration it has undergone.
It may be affirmed that milk of
this kind, though prepared nine months
before, may supply the place of the
greater part of the cream sold at Paris.
What however will appear more extraordinary
is, that this same milk having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
been put into a pint bottle which was
uncorked a month before, to take out
a part of it, and re-corked afterwards
with little care, was also preserved,
having undergone scarcely any change.
At first it appeared to have somewhat
thickened, but a slight shaking was
sufficient to bring back its ordinary liquidity.
I present it here in the same
bottle, that you may convince yourselves
of a fact, which I should have
had a difficulty to believe, if I had
heard of it only, without having the
evidence before me.</p>

<p>The <i>whey</i> which we afterwards examined,
presented some singular appearances
not less astonishing. It had
all the transparency of whey recently
prepared. Its colour was deeper, it
had a stronger taste, and it was somewhat
thicker. It underwent a change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
also with less rapidity, having been exposed
to the air at the end of a fortnight;
for a bottle opened six weeks
ago, occasionally shaken, and ill corked,
did not begin to lose its transparency
till the end of a fortnight. Its surface
at the end of more than a month
was covered with a somewhat thick
mouldiness, which when carefully taken
off, left the remainder still possessing
the flavour of whey.</p>

<p>The <i>green peas</i> and the <i>Windsor
beans</i>, boiled with the attention enjoined
by Mr. Appert, furnished two
excellent dishes, which the remoteness
of the usual season of such vegetables
appeared to render still more finely
flavoured and agreeable.</p>

<p>Whole <i>cherries</i>, and <i>apricots</i> cut in
quarters preserved a great part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
flavour they had when gathered. It is
true Mr. Appert was obliged to gather
them before they were quite ripe, lest
they should lose too much of their
figure in the glass jars in which they
were preserved.</p>

<p>The <i>currant</i> and <i>raspberry juice</i> appeared
to us to enjoy almost all their
qualities. We found the aroma of the
raspberry perfectly preserved, as well
as the somewhat aromatic acid of the
currant. Their colour only was a little
faded.</p>

<p>Such were the results on our examining
the substances prepared according to Mr.
Appert’s process, more than eight months,
and some of them a year, and fifteen
months before; for instance, the whey.
We could only receive his statement as
to the time of the previous preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of these articles, as they had been
deposited but two months with the
Society; but even this shorter period
is sufficient to give us a favourable
opinion of the author’s process. We
are the more justified in relying on
Mr. Appert’s declarations, as persons
highly worthy of credit, have by their
own experiments, convinced themselves
that similar substances may be preserved
for more than a year. Mr.
Appert forwarded to the Council mere
specimens of the articles I have enumerated;
but he prepares a still greater
variety of alimentary substances. He
did not communicate his process to us.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Observations.</i></p>

<p>The art of better preserving vegetables
and animal substances in the
state in which nature produces them,
has been to a considerable degree the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
object both of pharmacy and chymistry.
To attain that end various means have
been employed. Desiccation, ardent
spirits, acids and oils, saccharine and
saline substances, &amp;c. have been made
use of; but it must be confessed that
these means cause many productions
to lose a part of their properties, or
otherwise modifies them, so that their
aroma and flavour are no longer to be
recognized. From this point of view,
the process of Mr. Appert appears to
us preferable, if without having recourse
to desiccation he adds no extraneous
substance to that he wishes to
preserve. There is every reason to
believe that his method is by so much
the better, as the substances on which
he operates are more capable of sustaining
so high a temperature without a
sensible change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Several persons of acknowledged
merit, have by desire of the prefects
in different Seaports, examined Mr.
Appert’s preparations. It is only necessary
to read the reports made by
these well-informed persons, in order
to be convinced of the excellence of the
author’s process.</p>

<p>At Brest, for instance, on the 14th
of April 1807, the committee named
by the Maritime Prefect express themselves
as follows:</p>

<p>“It is demonstrated by every thing
just said, that all the alimentary substances,
in number eighteen, embarked
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Stationnaire</i>, December 12, 1806,
and disembarked April 13, 1807, and
which were examined by a committee
for that especial purpose, under the
presidency of a commissary of marine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
belonging to the hospitals, underwent
no change while they were on board,
and that they were in the same state
at the several periods of the embarkation
and disembarkation.</p>

<p>“It may be added that Mr. Appert’s
process for the preservation of the articles
examined, has been followed by all
the success he had promised himself;
and that with improvement, which he
considers as very easy, and finding
means to diminish the number of vessels
employed, these provisions would
offer great advantages on board his
majesty’s and other vessels.”</p>

<p>The Committee nominated at Bourdeaux
by the Prefect of the Department,
assert, positively:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>“The detail which we have just
given, on the objects prepared by Mr.
Appert, will point out to you that they
were in a state of perfect preservation;
that the means made use of do not depend
on the addition of extraneous
substances, and that these means are
founded on a process invented or improved
by Mr. Appert, which do not
destroy the perfume or flavour of the
subjects submitted to their influence.”</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Allemand wrote a letter
to Mr. Appert, of which I subjoin
a copy.</p>

<p>“I communicated your letter, Sir,
to the Captains, under my orders, and
they tasted the day before yesterday
the vegetables I purchased of you
fourteen months ago, one bottle of
which my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître-d’hôtel</i> had by accident
left in the store-room. As green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
peas and beans are just beginning to be
gathered, the officers actually believed
your preserved vegetables to be fresh,
so well had you succeeded; they wish
to purchase a large quantity of them,
as well as soup, fruit, and meat in bottles.
I shall also take a considerable
quantity for myself at the end of the
season.</p>

<p>“I am so well persuaded, Sir, of
the infinite advantage which would attend
the providing a quantity of articles
for the use of the sick on board, that
if his Excellency, the Minister of the
Marine and Colonies, should do me the
honour to ask for my opinion, I shall
not hesitate to confirm this my opinion,
as well for the sake of the government
and of the sick, as of yourself. I shall
take the earliest opportunity to speak
with him on the subject. Accept the
assurance of my high consideration.</p>

Martin, Maritime Prefect, to Mr.

<p>“I have received, Sir, your letter of
the 27th of last April. According to
your desire, I have addressed to his
Excellency, the Minister of the Marine
and Colonies, a report of the examination
of a variety of provisions prepared according
to your process.</p>

<p>“I shall neglect no opportunity of
making known a discovery which appears
to be as useful to the State as it is
interesting to seamen. I have the honour
to salute you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>It is apparent from these reports,
which appear to be almost the same,
though made in towns remote from
each other, at different periods and by
different persons, that the process of
Mr. Appert is as certain as it is useful.
It affords the means of enjoying throughout
the empire, during the whole year,
and with great convenience, the productions
which belong alone to a part
of it, without fearing that they may
have undergone any change by their
having been transported to a great distance,
or from the remoteness of the
season of their growth. Merely under
this point of view, the advantage appears
to be great: and it has not escaped
the notice of the poets and
amiable writers, who, to amuse themselves,
sing the art of cookery. Mr.
Appert has repeatedly received from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
them the most flattering and highly deserved
praises.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>The process of this manufacturer is
not less valuable in the sparing of sugar
in the use of fruit; for without the aid
of that article, it preserves the juice
till the moment of its consumption,
when only a small portion needs to be
added to the juice; double the quantity
would have been necessary to <em>preserve</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the same fruit. It may be further added
that the flavour and aroma of substances
are better preserved by Mr.
Appert’s process, than by the decoctions
usually made use of in order to preserve
them with sugar. This will be considered
as a very great advantage, when
we reflect how prodigious a quantity
of this colonial produce is every
year employed to preserve the different
kinds of fruit and their juices. The
establishment of Mr. Appert has not
perhaps been duly appreciated by rich
capitalists, who might have given it
that desirable extension which it will
only gradually receive, if the author is
abandoned to his own resources.</p>

<p>The success he has already met with,
increases his zeal and makes him carry
his views further. He promises to transmit,
unchanged, the most agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
productions of our soil beyond the Line.
He purposes to multiply the enjoyments
of the Indian, the Mexican, and the
African, as well as of the Laplander,
and to transport into France from remote
regions, an infinity of substances
which we should desire to receive in
their natural state.</p>

<p>The experiments already made on
board several vessels, prove that the
sick among a crew will be well satisfied
with Mr. Appert’s preparations, which
furnish them with the means of procuring,
when necessary, meat and
broth of a good quality, milk, acid
fruits, and even anti-scorbutic juices;
for Mr. Appert assures us he is able to
preserve these also.</p>

<p>With respect to the embarkation of
meat necessary for a whole crew on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
long voyage, a slight difficulty seems
to lie in the requisite multiplicity of
bottles. But Mr. Appert will, without
doubt, find means to obviate this inconvenience,
by the choice of vessels
less fragile and of a larger size.</p>

<p>Our opinion of the substances preserved
by Mr. Appert, and transmitted
to our examination, is, that they were
all of a good quality, that they may be
made use of without any inconvenience;
and that the Society owes great praise
to the author for having so far advanced
the art of preserving vegetable and animal
substances. We are happy to render
this homage to the zeal and disinterestedness
with which he has laboured
to attain his end.</p>

<p>When the relations of commerce
shall be rendered more easy, Mr. Appert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
will require nothing beyond his
own talents and perseverance, to establish
a branch of commerce as useful to
himself as to his country; but at the
present moment his fellow citizens cannot
better recompense his labours, than
by employing the produce of his manufactures.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;Mr. Appert desires to preserve
his connection with the Society,
in order to inform them of the result of
the fresh exertions to which he is about
to devote himself, on the invitation of
your committee.</p>

Though a small quantity of salt may be an obstacle in the
way of putrefaction, the too abundant and frequent use
which is made of it, must cause great obstructions in the
smaller vessels of the body, and these obstructions cannot
fail to overload the stomach of men who have to digest dry
vegetables and biscuits, which sailors advanced in years are
not always able to chew completely. Bad digestion and
obstruction in the smaller vessels may occasionally give rise

on the other hand, it would do great injury to those substances
to let them remain too long exposed to the heat.
Without inconvenience, therefore, in private families, any
cauldron or earthen vessel may be taken for a water-bath,
provided the water rises to the rim of the bottle. In case
there should be no vessel sufficiently high, the bottles may
be laid down in the water-bath, care being taken to pack
them well together, lest they should be broken. Many
operations have succeeded well with me this way. The
corks are somewhat more liable to burst outwards; but if
the bottles are well corked, there is nothing to be feared.
For instance, it would not be advisable to lay on their
sides, bottles, or other vessels stopped up with stoppers consisting
of different pieces of any substance, because the
action of the fire upon this kind of stopper is stronger;
and however well the vessel might be corked, it would not
be advisable to incur the risque.
</p>
<p>
Small water-baths are the more convenient, because they
may be placed any where, and removed at will. They
soon become cold. The bottles are taken out when the
water is sufficiently cool to allow of the finger being put
in, and thus the operation is terminated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> Many persons believe they have corked well, when
they have forced the cork even with the mouth of the
bottle; but this is a great mistake. On the contrary,
whenever the whole of the cork, instead of withstanding
the blows of the bat, is forced into the bottle, it is adviseable
to draw it out and substitute another in its place.
Thus the believing that a bottle corked very low is well
corked, because no liquor escapes when the bottle is turned
with its neck downwards, is an error, which, joined to
the use of bad corks, causes a number of losses. He who
corks with care and judgment is satisfied that the operation
has been performed well by the resistance of the cork
to the blows of the bat, and never thinks of turning the
neck of the bottle downwards. It is besides sufficient to
reflect on the punctures met with in cork, and on all the
hidden defects which may subsist in the interior even of
the finest cork, by means of which, the air may be introduced;
in order to be convinced of the propriety of making
use of none but the very best corks, and that, after having
well compressed them in the machine for that purpose;
and also of corking them so closely that they become very
much compressed in the middle.
</p>
<p>
It is in this way only, that losses can be prevented from
frequently taking place, which have often no other cause
than bad corking; for, if a bottle does not instantly run
when carelessly corked, it proceeds from this circumstance,
that the air has not had time to penetrate through the
apertures which may be in the interior of the cork: and,
in fact, how different is the quality of wine, drawn from
the same cask! and how many bottles do we meet with,
which have lost more or less of their contents!</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_J_10" id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> The celebrated <span class="smcap">Chaptal</span> says, in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elémens de
Chimie, discours préliminaire</i>, p. cxxxi. “We hear in
manufactories of nothing but the <em>caprice of experiment</em>,
but this vague phrase has its origin only in the ignorance
in which the workmen are of the true principles of their
art; for nature does not act according to any principle of
discernment, but obeys constant laws. The dead matter
which we employ in our manufactories, exhibits necessary
effects in which the will can have no share, and consequently
can have no caprice. Make yourself acquainted,
we should say to the manual operator, with the substance
on which you are to operate, study better the principles of
your art, and you will be able to foresee, predict and calculate
every thing. It is your ignorance alone which
renders your operations a constant groping in the dark,
and a discouraging alternation of success and disappointment.”
</p>
<p>
In fact, the operator who proceeds with a perfect knowledge
of the principles of his art, and of the results of its
application, will never ascribe the failure of his process to
caprice, but will impute it to the neglect of some indispensable
precaution in the application of his principle;
and his disappointment will serve as a guide for him to
calculate better and improve his preparatory process.
Convinced that the effects that flow from his principle are
invariable, he knows that every kind of loss and damage
can proceed only from an error in the application of his
principle.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_O_15" id="Footnote_O_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_O_15"><span class="label">[O]</span></a> The mode of extracting the juice of plants by means
of water has more or less inconvenience. All those
juices which have a principle that is very volatile and easy
to evaporate, lose infinitely, even in warm water; much
more so therefore, when the heat of the water is raised to
a higher degree, and when the plants have been left for a
long time in digestion.
</p>
<p>
Aromatic vegetables are infused, when the object is to
preserve the aroma, and not impart to the water the
extractive principle which the plant contains. Therefore,
tea and coffee are made by infusion. But all the theories
ancient and modern, and all the new apparatus employed
to seize and hold fast the aroma of the coffee are still very
deficient.
</p>
<p>
Ebullition which is often times resorted to in order to
extract the aroma of plants by means of distillation,
in spite of all the apparatus made use of for keeping the
same closed up, most frequently destroys the nature of
the productions.
</p>
<p>
Not only are the principles extracted by the water injured
by this first operation, but they scarcely retain any
strength after the evaporation which it is usual to make
them undergo, in order to form essences of them. The
extract therefore, exhibits nothing but the appearance of
the soluble and nutritive principles of vegetable and animal
substances; since fire, which is necessary to form an essence
by means of evaporation, destroys the aroma and
almost all the properties of the substance which contains it.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_S_19" id="Footnote_S_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_S_19"><span class="label">[S]</span></a> Some persons of enlightened understandings, but
who have, perhaps, delivered themselves over to the spirit
of system and prejudice, have declared themselves against
my method, alleging a pretended impossibility. But is
it then difficult on the principles of a sound, natural
philosophy, to assign a reason for the preservation of
alimentary substance by my process? May we not infer,
that the application of <em>caloric</em>, or heat, to the water-bath,
operates in producing a gentle fusion of the constituent
fermenting principles, so as to destroy the predominating
agency of fermentation? This agency is an essential condition
of fermentation, at least of its taking place with
a certain promptitude. Further, there is no fermentation
without air; this being also excluded by my method,
we have two assignable causes for its success; the theory
of which appears to flow naturally from the means practically
employed.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, if we refer to any of the methods made use of
and any of the experiments and observations of ancient
and modern times, upon the preservation of alimentary
substances, with which we are acquainted, we shall find
that <em>fire</em> is every where the principal agent, either in the
natural duration, or in the artificial preservation of vegetable
and animal substances.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Fabroni</cite> has proved that heat applied to grape juice or
must, destroys the fermentation of this <em>vegeto-animal</em>,
which is pre-eminently <em>leaven</em>. <cite>Thenard</cite> has made like
experiments on cherries, gooseberries, and other fruits.
The experiments of the late <cite>Vilaris</cite>, and of Mr. <cite>Cazalès</cite>,
learned chymists at Bourdeaux, who have dried meat by
means of stoves, equally prove that the application of
heat destroys the agents of putrefaction.
</p>
<p>
Drying, boiling, evaporating, as well as the caustic and
savoury substances which are employed in the preservation
of alimentary productions, all serve to shew that caloric
in its various modes of application, produces the same
effects.</p></div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
